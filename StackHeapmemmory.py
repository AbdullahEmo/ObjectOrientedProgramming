1. methods and vairables are created on stack memory.
	methods_example=__init__(self,m) vairables=m
	def __init(self,m)
		self.wheels=m
		self.man=n

2. the objects and instance are created on heap memory
	wheels & man is instances

def __init(self,m)
	self.wheels=m
def getvalue():
	return self.wheels


n=a.getvalue()
3. a.getvalue and self will be created on the stack memory

4. print() will be created on the stack memory

5. c1=5
   c2=5

   """ c1 & c2 is Object_Name and 5 is an Object_ """
	which indicate on object 5
6. some times self belongs to object_name
7. class computer:
	def __init__(self,name)

c1=computer()
here self is a pointer and "c1 is self" as if self.age==c1.age 
9. there are two types of variable 1/ instance variable 2/ clas.s variable Or static variable
 instance variable which Is use Inside  __init__ method And outside init calls static variable
10. there are three kinds of Methods 1/ instance Methods 2/ Class Methods 3/ Static Methods
